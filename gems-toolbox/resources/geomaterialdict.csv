94,05.03.03,Meta-felsic and intermediate rock,----Meta-felsic and intermediate rock,"Rock derived from preexisting felsic and intermediate-composition rocks by essentially solid-state, mineralogical, chemical, or structural changes, in response to marked changes in temperature, pressure, deformation, and (or) chemical environment, generally at depth in Earths crust. Composed mostly of light-colored minerals; relatively enriched in silica. Includes metagranite, metadiorite, and meta-andesite."
